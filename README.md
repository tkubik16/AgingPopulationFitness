# AgingPopulationFitness

This is a personal project which leverages a database which I designed to assist older humans with their personal fitness. The database contains exercises and their benefits. The database also contains body parts and the exercises are linked to these body parts if you should not do those exercises if you have an injur afflicting that body part. The database also stores user info such as username and password as well as the users injuries that they add as well as thier saved exercises for future reference.
